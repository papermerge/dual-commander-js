    <h1>Dual Commander</h1>
    <p>
      This feature demo focuses on correct behaviour of dual commander within context of several
      documents and folders. You should be able navigate each commander panel by clicking respective
      folder (in panel and in breadcrumb).
      When clicking a document - it must open in other panel. In the opened viewer
      you should be able to zoom in/zoom out pages. Also, by clicking a folder in viewer's breadcrumb
      the viewer will 'close' and commander will replace it.
